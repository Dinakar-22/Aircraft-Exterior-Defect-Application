Title :	Build Applications for the Aerospace Industry with the Aircraft Exterior Defect API

Explain what is the proposed solutions/plan of action to solve the challenge.

The  Machine Learning Powerd Application for the aerospace industry to detect Aircraft Exterior Defect management of exterior defects on aircraft safety, maintenance procedures, and overall operational excellence.this API enables efficient and accurate detection, analysis.This allows for the automatic identification and categorization of various types of exterior defects, such as scratches, dents, corrosion, paint irregularities, and other imperfections on the aircraft's surface.

Note: What is the uniqueness added by you to the solution. Also. if there are solutions in the market to similar challenges, what is the innovation you propose to make your solution better.

User-friendly interface allowing users to upload aircraft exterior images and initiate defect analysis and  images .
Database or storage system for storing and organizing inspection records for future reference and analysis.
Image analysis algorithms and techniques are implemented to provide detailed defect information

Note: What do you think could be the business or social implications of your solution? in terms of time to roll out, budget, and resources required, etc. How would your solution improve business & impact the society?

Note: Architectural flow of the proposed solution, with the mention of technologies to be used in developing solution.
Note: Define the scope of work to be implemented in the project with modules etc.
